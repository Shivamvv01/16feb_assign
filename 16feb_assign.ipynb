    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored electronically. It allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. Databases are commonly used in various applications, from websites to enterprise systems.\n",

    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL databases are two different types of database management systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that use tables to store data. They are ideal for structured data with well-defined relationships. SQL databases are known for their ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance and are suitable for applications requiring data consistency and complex queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases designed for unstructured or semi-structured data. They offer flexibility in data storage and are suitable for applications with constantly changing data requirements. NoSQL databases often prioritize scalability and can handle large amounts of data with horizontal scaling."
